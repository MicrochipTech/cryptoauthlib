 * The Delete command, when executed, will clear all of the Data zone slots and set
 * all bytes of each slot to 0xFF.The Configuration zone will be untouched, except for the
 * value of the Primary_Deleted byte.
 *
 * \note List of devices that support this command - ECC204, TA010, SHA10x.Refer to device datasheets for full details.
