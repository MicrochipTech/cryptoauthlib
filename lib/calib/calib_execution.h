/**
 * \file
 * \brief Defines an execution handler that executes a given command on a
 *        device and returns the results.
 *
 * The basic flow is to wake the device, send the command, wait/poll for
 * completion, and finally receives the response from the device and does
 * basic checks before returning to caller.
 *
 * This handler supports the ATSHA and ATECC device family.
