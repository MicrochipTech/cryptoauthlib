 * \brief CryptoAuthLib Basic API methods for HMAC command.
 *
 * The HMAC command computes an HMAC/SHA-256 digest using a key stored in the
 * device over a challenge stored in the TempKey register, and/or other
 * information stored within the device.
 *
 * \note List of devices that support this command - ATSHA204A, ATECC108A, and
 *       ATECC508A . There are differences in the modes that they support.
 *       Refer to device datasheets for full details.

/** \brief Issues a HMAC command, which computes an HMAC/SHA-256 digest of a
 *          key stored in the device, a challenge, and other information on the
 *          device.
 *
 * \param[in]  device  Device context pointer
 * \param[in]  mode    Controls which fields within the device are used in the
 *                     message.
 * \param[in]  key_id  Which key is to be used to generate the response.
 *                     Bits 0:3 only are used to select a slot but all 16 bits
 *                     are used in the HMAC message.
 * \param[out] digest  HMAC digest is returned in this buffer (32 bytes).
 *
 * \return ATCA_SUCCESS on success, otherwise an error code.
